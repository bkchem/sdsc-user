Makefiles for LAMMPS
====================

The following Makefiles have been tested with LAMMPS 8-Jul-13:

* Makefile.gordon-fftw - SDSC Gordon with Intel compilers, MVAPICH2, and FFTW3
* Makefile.gordon-mkl  - SDSC Gordon with Intel compilers, MVAPICH2, and Intel MKL FFTs
* Makefile.trestles - SDSC Gordon with PGI compilers, MVAPICH2, and FFTW3

The following Makefile has been tested with LAMMPS 5-Mar-12:

* Makefile.excalibur - Rutgers Excalibur with IBM XL compilers, IBM mpich-based MPI, and IBM ESSL

Excalibur is not exactly an SDSC resource, but Rutgers is an XSEDE level 3 service provider.  That's close enough, right?
